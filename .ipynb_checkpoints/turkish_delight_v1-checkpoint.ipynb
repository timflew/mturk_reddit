My analyses are going to be based on the [mturk](https://www.reddit.com/r/mturk/) subreddit. Note, I didn't use other subreddits like HitsWorthTurkingFor because most of those posts are just brief descriptions of the HIT--By virtue of being on that subreddit these HITs are *already* good."

In the last batch we posted, there were an alarming number of workers who didn't give adequate answers-- they were either way underdeveloped (i.e., three words where sentences were clearly called for), or fairly nonsensical (I suspected bots in this situations, though I suppose someone not very good at English could have produced some of these responses).

The best ones that come in I can only seem to get about 25% of the time. This is while I'm working on a hit in one tab I react to the beep and try to PANDA the new good one. If I don't get it, I put it into turkmaster and auto accept it. This ends yielding me the hit about 10% of the time. How should I use these two scripts together? I mostly do surveys. Can never seem to find profitable batches. \n",
